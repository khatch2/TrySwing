This repository is my attempt to learn and experiment with Java Swing while using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

Overview
Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and provides a set of APIs for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java applications. This repository contains code and exercises as I explore the capabilities of Swing.

Project Goals
Learn the basics of Java Swing.
Build sample GUI applications to understand event handling, layouts, and components.
Experiment with creating interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.
Features
Code Examples: A collection of Java Swing examples showcasing various components like buttons, panels, menus, and more.
Learning Journey: Incremental progress as I dive deeper into Swing.
Hands-On Practice: Code snippets and mini-projects to solidify concepts.
